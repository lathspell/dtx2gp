== Input ==

; Bar 000
;   Lane 0x11 with Sample 0x05 as 1/8th notes on 1,1&,2&,3,4,4&
#00011: 0005000505000505
;   Lane 0x12 with Sample 0x02 as 1/4th notes on 1, 2 and 4
#00012: 02020002
;   Lane 0x13 with Sample 0x02 as 1/2th notes on 1 and 3
#00013: 0303

== Processing ==

* Max number of beats is 8 so fill up every lane with zero
* Sample 00 as well as fill ups become empty notes

#000:
 11: - 5, - 5, 5 -, 5 5
 12: 2 -, 2 -, - -, 2 -
 13: 3 -, - -, 3 -, - -

* Sample number are irrelevant, for us they are just a bit map
* Lanes can be mapped to midi instruments and "voices" (i.e. stems up or down)

    Lane 11 = Midi 42 "HiHat" at voice 0
    Lane 12 = Midi 38 "Snare" at voice 1
    Lane 13 = Midi 36 "Bass"  at voice 1

#000:
  Beat:  0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7
    _________________________________________
    11:  - 42  - 42 42  - 42 42    -> voice 0
    12: 38  - 38  -  -  - 38  -    -> voice 1
    13: 36  -  -  - 36  -  -  -    -> voice 1

* Rests that are at the same position as a note in that voice are void

#000
  Beat:        0   1    2    3    4    5    6    7
  ________________________________________________
  Voice 0:     -  42    -   42   42    -   42   42
  Voice 1: 36,38   -   38    -   36    -   38    -

// OPTIONAL:
* Empty notes at the beginning are replaced by rests
* Notes are expanded if an empty note follows and they are on the main beat
  (i.e. 1/8th on count "1" would be expanded, 1/8th on count "1&" not)
